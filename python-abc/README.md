# Python ABC (Abstract Base Classes) Exercises

This project contains exercises focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including abstract classes, interfaces, duck typing, and subclassing standard base classes.

## Files

1. task_00_abc.py - Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses
2. task_01_duck_typing.py - Shapes, Interfaces, and Duck Typing
3. task_02_verboselist.py - Extending the Python List with Notifications
4. task_03_countediterator.py - CountedIterator - Keeping Track of Iteration
5. task_04_flyingfish.py - The Enigmatic FlyingFish - Exploring Multiple Inheritance
6. task_05_dragon.py - The Mystical Dragon - Mastering Mixins

Each task file has a corresponding main file for testing.

## Usage

To run each exercise, use the following command:

python3 main_XX_filename.py


Replace XX with the task number and filename with the corresponding file name.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply abstract classes
- Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing
- Learn to extend standard base classes
- Employ method overriding
- Understand and apply multiple inheritance
- Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes
